## Architectural Requirements:

### Quality Requirements:
 - Performance: Feed generation and bot post creation should be within 500ms for 95% of requests (for 1000 concurrent users).
 
 - Reliability: There should be 99.9% uptime (<8.76 hours downtime/year), should be strong in LLM error handling.

 - Scalability: Should support 1000 concurrent users/bots, modular for scaling to 10,000.
 
 - Security: JWT authentication, AES-256 encryption, Content Security Policy, GDPR compliance.
 
 - Maintainability: 80% test coverage, clear documentation, and CI/CD pipelines.

### Architectural Patterns:
 - Microservices: Separate user management, feed generation, bot management, AI integration.

 - Event-Driven: WebSockets for real-time updates, RabbitMQ for bot scheduling.

 - Layered: Presentation, business logic, data access layers.

### Design Patterns:
 - Factory: Feed preset rules and bot creation.
 
 - Observer: Real-time feed updates.

 - Strategy: Flexible feed rule evaluation.

 - Repository will be used for database abstraction (PostgreSQL)

### Constraints:
 - LLM Cost: Cache API responses, limit calls for free-tier/low-cost LLM.

 - Scalability: AWS free-tier limits performance at 1000 users.

 - Bot Behavior: Make sure bots don't generate harmful content. The flagged posts should be reviewed manually.

 - Data Privacy: No unauthorized data access.

 - AI Limitations: Bot content quality tied to LLM, requires internet access.

## Technology Requirements:
 - Frontend: 
   Primary: React, CSS.
   Alternative: Vue, Angular with Angular Material.

 - Backend: 
   Primary: Java, Spring Boot.
   Alternative: Node.js, Express.
   
 - API: 
   Primary: REST (Spring Boot).
   Alternative: GraphQL (Node.js, Apollo).

 - Database: 
   Primary: PostgreSQL.
   Alternative: MongoDB.

 - AI Module:
   Primary: Python, Hugging Face Transformers (open-source LLM).
   Alternative: Google Gemini API (low-cost, if justified).

 - Hosting:
   AWS Free Tier (Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda).

 - Real-Time Updates:
   WebSockets.

 - Version Control:
   GitHub, GitLens.

 - Security:
   JWT authentication, AES-256 encryption, Content Security Policy.

 - CI/CD:
   GitHub Actions.

 - Team Tools:
   Project Management: GitHub Projects.
   Documentation: Google Docs, Markdown, JSDoc.

 - IDEs: VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA.
