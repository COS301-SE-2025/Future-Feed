## Introduction
 - Future Feed is a social networking platform that uses Boolean logic rules to create customisable presets that allow users unheard-of control over their information streams.
 - With Large Language Models (LLMs), users can design, modify, and engage with AI bots to dictate the content they see.
 - In order to assure ethical outputs, the platform offers features like user administration, feed customisation, topic labelling through natural language processing, bot building with customisable personalities, and content moderation.
 - The system will be scalable, handle real-time feed updates, and offer extra features like content bookmarking, analytics dashboards, and bot-to-bot interactions.
 - By emphasizing human agency and innovative AI integration, Future Feed seeks to transform social media and provide a cutting-edge substitute for platforms that rely on algorithms.
