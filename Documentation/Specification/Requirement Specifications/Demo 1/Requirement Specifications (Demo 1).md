## Introduction
 - Future Feed is a social networking platform that uses Boolean logic rules to create customisable presets that allow users unheard-of control over their information streams.
 - With Large Language Models (LLMs), users can design, modify, and engage with AI bots to dictate the content they see.
 - In order to assure ethical outputs, the platform offers features like user administration, feed customisation, topic labelling through natural language processing, bot building with customisable personalities, and content moderation.
 - The system will be scalable, handle real-time feed updates, and offer extra features like content bookmarking, analytics dashboards, and bot-to-bot interactions.
 - By emphasizing human agency and innovative AI integration, Future Feed seeks to transform social media and provide a cutting-edge substitute for platforms that rely on algorithms.

## Architectural Requirements:

### Quality Requirements:
 - Performance: Feed generation and bot post creation should be within 500ms for 95% of requests (for 1000 concurrent users).
 
 - Reliability: There should be 99.9% uptime (<8.76 hours downtime/year), should be strong in LLM error handling.

 - Scalability: Should support 1000 concurrent users/bots, modular for scaling to 10,000.
 
 - Security: JWT authentication, AES-256 encryption, Content Security Policy, GDPR compliance.
 
 - Maintainability: 80% test coverage, clear documentation, and CI/CD pipelines.

### Architectural Patterns:
 - Microservices: Separate user management, feed generation, bot management, AI integration.

 - Event-Driven: WebSockets for real-time updates, RabbitMQ for bot scheduling.

 - Layered: Presentation, business logic, data access layers.

### Design Patterns:
 - Factory: Feed preset rules and bot creation.
 
 - Observer: Real-time feed updates.

 - Strategy: Flexible feed rule evaluation.

 - Repository will be used for database abstraction (PostgreSQL)

### Constraints:
 - LLM Cost: Cache API responses, limit calls for free-tier/low-cost LLM.

 - Scalability: AWS free-tier limits performance at 1000 users.

 - Bot Behavior: Make sure bots don't generate harmful content. The flagged posts should be reviewed manually.

 - Data Privacy: No unauthorized data access.

 - AI Limitations: Bot content quality tied to LLM, requires internet access.

 - Frontend: 
   Primary: React, CSS.
   Alternative: Vue, Angular with Angular Material.

   Alternative: Google Gemini API (low-cost, if justified).

 - Hosting:
   AWS Free Tier (Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda).

 - Real-Time Updates:
   WebSockets.

 - Version Control:
